trails lets the user create, edit and print his own “web booklet”. The key concept of the project is the transformation of combined website fragments (texts and images) into a print medium. With a mouse click the web fragments become editable, and the booklet can be extended with personal content, notes etc.

The structure of the book layout is clean, but with enough basic flexibility to let everyone pursue his/her own design.
